# Keynote: Markus Voelter - Envisioning Future Language Workbenches

Over the last couple of years, I have used MPS successfully to build
interesting (modeling and programming) languages in a wide variety of
domains, targeting  bothbusiness users and engineers. I've used MPS
because it is currently the most powerful language workbench, lots of
things are good about iz, in particular, its support for a multitude of
notations and language modularity. But it is also obvious that MPS is
not going to be viable for the medium to long term future; the most
obvious reason for this statement is that it is not web/cloud-based. In
this keynote, I will quickly recap why and how we have been successful
with MPS, and point out how language workbenches could look like in the
future; I will outline challenges, opportunities and research problems.
I hope to spawn discussions for the remainder of the workshop.


Biography: Markus works as a language engineer, bridging the gap from industry and business domains to software systems. He analyses domains, designs user-friendly languages and supporting analyses, and implements language tools and IDEs, architects efficient and reliable backends based on interpreters and generators. He also works on formalisms and meta-tools for language engineering. Reach him via http://voelter.de.
