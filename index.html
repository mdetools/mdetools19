                <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

                <p> For software engineering research results to impact modern, industrial software development and how it is taught in
                significant ways, the implementation and encapsulation of
                the results in sufficiently mature, effective, and usable tools
                appears to be a necessity. The more effective, usable, and
                available these tools and their supporting documentation
                materials are, the easier it is for prospective users to determine
                the scope, benefits, and limitations of the tools in relevant
                contexts, thus maximizing the potential for more adoption
                and impact. </p>
                <p>While the implementation and maintenance of such tools
                is not trivial and typically cannot be accomplished without
                significant resources, many recent technological advances
                (e.g., frameworks, libraries, and metatools such as language
                workbenches), standards, and social developments (e.g., the
                increasing trend towards open source software and the sharing
                of expertise via question-and-answer websites such as
                stackoverflow.com) can provide substantial help. Similarly,
                the creation of effective supporting documentation is often
                facilitated through the use of more “modern” formats such
                as screen casts and video tutorials, which can then easily
                be dissiminated via services such as YouTube or FaceBook. </p>
                <p>Many other communities have recognized the importance
                of tools and, e.g., created workshops specifically designed to
                facilitate the evaluation and comparison of tools. Examples
                include (all held in 2016),</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://2016.splashcon.org/track/lwc2016">the Language Workbench Challenge</a> </li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.transformation-tool-contest.eu/2016/">the Transformation Tool Contest</a> </li>
                    <li><a href="https://baldur.iti.kit.edu/sat-competition-2016/">the SAT Competition</a> </li>
                    <li><a href="http://etaps2016.verifythis.org/">the VerifyThis Verification Competition</a> </li>
                    </a> </li>
                </ul>

                <p> While efforts have been made to compare modeling approaches
                (in, e.g., <a href="http://cserg0.site.uottawa.ca/cma2013models/">the Comparing Modeling Approaches Workshop</a>), the modeling research community does not appear to be paying as much attention as some other communities
                to more effectively leveraging tools for illustrating, evaluating, and dissiminating research results, and for making a
                convincing case for more wide-spread adoption of modeling
                and MDE. More specifically,
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>there is evidence suggesting that the quality of documentation
                    of many MDE tools is too low,</li>
                    <li>there is insufficient support for determining and comparing
                    the strengths and weaknesses of MDE tools,
                    their suitability for specific tasks, and opportunities
                    for interoperation and reuse,</li>
                    <li>few repeatable tool evaluations and comparisons exist
                    that use appropriate, publicly accessible use cases and
                    that have been carried out by independent third parties, </li>
                    <li>challenges such as usability, interoperability, and integration
                    should receive more attention,</li>
                    <li>new and emerging applications and application domains
                    (such as the <a href="http://www.industryweek.com/systems-integration/demystifying-digital-thread-and-digital-twin-concepts">‘digital twin’ and ‘digital thread’ concepts</a>), and application domains (such as the
                    systems engineering, Industry 4.0, and the Internet
                    of Things), as well as recent technological and industrial
                    developments and trends such as open source
                    MDE tooling, Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration
                    (OSLC) and Microsoft’s Language Server Protocol
                    (LSP) are largely unstudied.</li>

                </ul>

                 <h2 id="objective">Objectives</h2>
                  <p>The high-level goal of the workshop is to support the effective
                    development, maintenance, dissimination, and use of highquality
                    MDE tools and supporting documentation material.
                    To this end, the workshop has the following objectives:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Facilitate the determination of the state-of-the-art in
                    MDE tools and comparative evaluations of existing
                    tools by identifying comparison criteria, use cases, and
                    evaluation procedures,</li>
                    <li>Discuss strengths, weaknesses of tools, together with opportunities
                    for improvements, reuse, and ‘cross-fertilization’,</li>
                    <li>Identify relevant industrial trends, opportunities and
                    challenges and how they can be leveraged or dealt with,</li>
                    <li>Collect best practices for the development, distribution,
                    and maintenance of MDE tools and any supporting
                    material.</li>
                </ol> 

               <p>
                The workshop welcomes regular paper submissions on
                these topics. But, to facilitate the comparison of tools, it
                also solicits submissions that demonstrate the use and utility
                of a specific tool for model-driven software development
                in the context of a <strong>challenge problem</strong>. The problem involves
                a rover navigation task defined through a stand-alone
                simulation environment that will be made available on the
                workshop webpage. Moreover, the workshop also features a
                <strong>video tutorials track</strong> which challenges the community to
                create appealing video tutorials that describe the use of a
                tool for a specific purpose in an informative and accurate, but
                also effective and attractive way. Links to sample tutorials,
                tools, and some advice in the form of best practices will be
                made available on the workshop webpage.
