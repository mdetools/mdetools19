                <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

                <p> FFor software engineering research results to impact modern, industrial
software development and how it is taught in significant ways,
the implementation and encapsulation of the results in sufficiently
mature, effective, and usable tools appears to be a necessity. The
more effective, usable, and available these tools and their supporting
documentation materials are, the easier it is for prospective
users to determine the scope, benefits, and limitations of the tools in
relevant contexts, thus maximizing the potential for more adoption
and impact. </p>
                <p>While the implementation and maintenance of such tools is not
trivial and typically cannot be accomplished without significant
resources, many recent technological advances (e.g., frameworks,
libraries, and metatools such as language workbenches), standards,
and social developments (e.g., the increasing trend towards open
source software and the sharing of expertise via question-andanswer
websites such as stackoverflow.com) can provide substantial
help. Similarly, the creation of effective supporting documentation
is often facilitated through the use of more ‘modern’ formats such
as screen casts and video tutorials, which can then easily be
dissiminated via services such as YouTube or FaceBook.
Many other communities have recognized the importance of
tools and, e.g., created workshops specifically designed to facilitate
the evaluation and comparison of tools. Examples include (all held
in 2016),</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://2016.splashcon.org/track/lwc2016">the Language Workbench Challenge</a> </li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.transformation-tool-contest.eu/2016/">the Transformation Tool Contest</a> </li>
                    <li><a href="https://baldur.iti.kit.edu/sat-competition-2016/">the SAT Competition</a> </li>
                    <li><a href="http://etaps2016.verifythis.org/">the VerifyThis Verification Competition</a> </li>
                    </a> </li>
                </ul>

                <p> While efforts have been made to compare modeling approaches
(in, e.g., <a href="http://cserg0.site.uottawa.ca/cma2013models/">the Comparing Modeling Approaches Workshop</a>), the
modeling research community does not appear to be paying as
much attention as some other communities to more effectively leveraging
tools for illustrating, evaluating, and dissiminating research
results, and for making a convincing case for more wide-spread
adoption of modeling and MDE. More specifically,
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>there is evidence suggesting that the quality of documentation
of many MDE tools is too low,</li>
                    <li>there is insufficient support for comparing the strengths and
weaknesses of MDE tools, their suitability for specific tasks,
and opportunities for interoperation and reuse,</li>
                    <li>fuse appropriate, publicly accessible use cases and that have
been carried out by independent third parties,
• challenges such as usability, interoperability, and integration
should receive more attention,</li>
                    <li>
                    several existing and emerging technological capabilities (e.g.,
AI, analytics, cloud computing), challenges (e.g., DevOps,
Digital Twin & Thread, self-adaptation), and application
domains (e.g., Systems Engineering, Industry 4.0, robotics,
Internet of Things) are insufficiently leveraged or addressed,</li>

<li> recent technological and industrial developments, trends,
and community efforts such as open source MDE tooling,
Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) and the
Language Server Protocol (LSP) are largely unstudied.
</li>

                </ul>

                 <h2 id="objective">Objectives</h2>
                  <p>The MDETools Workshop aims to: </p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Facilitate
the determination of the state-of-the-art in MDE tools and comparative
evaluations of existing tools by identifying comparison
criteria, use cases, and evaluation procedures.</li>
                    <li>Discuss
strengths, weaknesses of tools, together with opportunities for
improvements, reuse, and ‘cross-fertilization’.</li>
                    <li>Identify relevant
industrial trends, opportunities and challenges and how they
can be leveraged or dealt with.</li>
                    <li>Collect best practices for the
development, distribution, and maintenance of MDE tools and
supporting material.</li>
                </ol> 

               <!--p>
                The workshop welcomes regular paper submissions on
                these topics. But, to facilitate the comparison of tools, it
                also solicits submissions that demonstrate the use and utility
                of a specific tool for model-driven software development
                in the context of a <strong>challenge problem</strong>. The problem involves
                a rover navigation task defined through a stand-alone
                simulation environment that will be made available on the
                workshop webpage. Moreover, the workshop also features a
                <strong>video tutorials track</strong> which challenges the community to
                create appealing video tutorials that describe the use of a
                tool for a specific purpose in an informative and accurate, but
                also effective and attractive way. Links to sample tutorials,
                tools, and some advice in the form of best practices will be
                made available on the workshop webpage.
