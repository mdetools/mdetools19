## Topics of interest
Submissions on aspects related to the development
and use of MDE tools and their supporting materials
are welcome. Topics of particular interest include:  
(1) Insightful descriptions of the state-of-the-art in MDE tooling,
in general and in the context of the workshop challenge problem.  
(2) Criteria and approaches for objective, repeatable tool evaluations
and comparisons.  
(3) Proposals for dealing with relevant tooling challenges such
as integration, interoperability, and usability, in general or in the
context of relevant technological existing or emerging capabilities
(e.g., AI, analytics, dynamic (i.e., ‘scripting’) languages,
cloud computing), developments (e.g., DevOps, Digital Twin
& Thread, self-adaptive systems) and application domains (e.g.,
Systems Engineering, Industry 4.0, robotics, cyber-physical systems,
Internet of Things).  
(4) Proposals on how to better leverage relevant standards (e.g.,
Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC)) and community
efforts (e.g., Microsoft’s Language Server Protocol, the
Eclipse ecosystem and open source tools in general).  
(5) Proposals for facilitating the creation, maintenance and dissemination
of high-quality tools and materials.


## Submissions

### Categories
Submissions should fall into one of the
following categories:

<ol type="I">
  <li><strong>Research papers:</strong> describe new and innovative ways how
MDE tools and their development can be improved; papers
addressing relevant challenges, trends, and opportunities
(see ‘Topics of Interest’) are particularly encouraged. </li>

  <li><strong>Comparisons and evaluations of MDE tools:</strong> describe
the tools compared or evaluated, criteria and data collection
processes used, and results obtained in a novel, insightful
way. Models used and data collected should be made publicly
available. Comparisons based on the submissions to the rover
challenge problem from MDETools’19 (available here) are
encouraged. Descriptions of novel ways to encourage or
facilitate evaluations and comparisons (e.g., proposals for
new challenge problems) are also welcome.</li>

  <li><strong>Position papers:</strong> clearly describe a position or opinion on
a relevant topic (see ‘Topics of Interest’) in an insightful
way; papers discussing challenges to the development of
high-quality MDE tools and supporting documentation and
how they could be mitigated or removed are particularly
encouraged.</li>

<li><strong>Descriptions of MDE tool use in context of the
challenge problem:</strong> describe (1) how significant aspects of the
challenge problem have been addressed with the help of an
MDE tool or tools, and (2) the strengths and weaknesses of
the tool in the context of the chosen problem. All created
models must be made public and information about how
they can be obtained must be provided. Additional information
on the artifacts to be submitted will be posted on the
workshop page). </li>



</ol>



## Submission website
Papers must be submitted electronically through [Eeaychair website](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=mdetools2019).


### Format and size limits
Submitted artifacts must be in English. Papers
must be between 6 and 10 pages in length, and follow the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE
manuscript template.

### Publication 
Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings published with IEEE and will be available
at the time of the workshop.


### Evaluation process and criteria
The submission and reviewing process will be handled using
EasyChair. All submissions will be reviewed by at least three
PC members. Acceptance decisions will be made based on
standard criteria such as correctness, clarity, and originality,
but also on the potential of the work to stimulate discussion,
inspire participants, and contribute to the success of the
workshop. 
Submissions with workshop organizers as (co-)authors will
be allowed, but care will be taken to enforce the [standard conflict rules](http://www.sigsoft.org/about/policies/pc-policy.htm) when assigning papers for review, collecting reviews,
and discussing submissions.
